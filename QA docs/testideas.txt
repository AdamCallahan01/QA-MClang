how does whitespae effect C-like parser?
make string lengths (C-like parser, Minecraft)


const str var = "????"

\t --> ' '
\n --> removed

\a\b\f\r\v escape character makes it through

bugs
    explicit const divide by 0 breaks compilation (but does not throw error)
    /? not recognized as legal command

interesting tokens
    const str explicit parsing
    execute subcommand clauses
    regular if's
    variable declaration/manipulation
    parsing of integer at compile time
        pretty smart
        divide by 0 breaks compilation (but does not throw error)
        need to specify const to use command insertion
    function arguments
